        <h1> Bunz Inventory</h1>
        <p>Bunz Inventory is an independent design exercise with a goal to create a feature from an existing product while putting myself in a time constraint. So what is Bunz Inventory anyway? It is a digital platform where users can share their items to other users.
</p>
        <p>In a two-week span, I have researched and used techniques from google's design sprints to bring my concept to life. Request a copy of the case study to learn more about this project.</p>

        <h3>Importance of Mapping out Actions</h3>
      </article>
      <article class="bunz-2r">
        <p>Mapping out the users actions through touch points helped me build out the user's flow. With this I was able to imagine the series of actions the users have done and how the product ultimately delivered their goal.</p>
          <p>I think building a storyboard that starts before using the product and ending the journey even after using the product gave me an idea on how the product benefited the users. Learn more about how I mapped out the user's journey in the case study.</p>

        <h3>Validating designs with user testing </h3>
        <p>I messaged my friends two sets of designs. I vaguely told them what the product is and asked them feedback about it. As expected, not only did they give me more insight about the things I missed, but they also gave some critical feedback on what works. (they are not designers, by the way) the design I initially gave them drastically (but not to its core) has changed.</p>
          <p>Read the case study to learn how my friends helped me with my design decisions. </p>

        <h1>Pitch In</h1>
        <p>Pitch In is a volunteering booking system born at a hackathon at Waterloo in June of 2019. The idea behind this project was to help connect volunteers and volunteer event organisers. In less than 48 hours, we created an idea to incentivize volunteering. </p> <p> Find out about our challenges and how we overcame (and failed) to develop our ideas in the case study.</p>

        <h3>Quick ideation
for instant results</h3>
<p>We had a tight time restriction at the hackathon. We need to think quick and agile. What my team and I did was that we sketched out how the product will work through a user's lens. We came up with three flows. One where the volunteer searches and applies for a volunteer event. Second is the flow where the user confirm's their application to the event organiser and the last flow is collecting rewards through the market place.</p>

        <h3>Designing a system of components and elements</h3>
        <p>After the hackathon, we decided that we will continue working on this idea. I created a library of components and elements so that my teammates have the tools to help them visualize their ideas. You can view these components in the link above.</p>

    <h1>Moving Posters</h1>
    <p>Moving Posters is a motion design project in one of my last courses at York Sheridan University. I was influenced by all the poster designs in Instagram and decided that I wanted to create my own posters with a twist. The set of posters are 4 traits that describe me as a designer by typography, motion, colour and other visual elements that all tie together.</p>
